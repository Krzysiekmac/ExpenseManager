# Expense Manager
> My first Java project.
It is a simple expense manager in which each expense entered by the user is summed up and saved as a text file.

## General Information
The program saves the entered expenditure taking into account the amount, date and category. 
The data is saved to a .txt text file. At the start, the program loads the previously saved values, so we obtain the continuity of the entered data.
The program is based on the JFrame class

## Technologies Used
- Tech 1 - JFrame
- Tech 2 - Maven


## Features
List the ready features here:
- saving to a text file
- loading from a text file


## Usage
After launching the program, enter the expense value, date and select the expense category from the drop-down list. Then press the "Add" button. 
The spend value will appear in the text box below. The user can add additional expenses or clear the list by selecting the "Clear" button. 
After closing the program, the entered data will be saved to a text file.


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress
In the future I'm going to add a save function to an excel file using the Apache POI libraries.
The plans also include the ability to sort expenses by date, value and category.
